Files:
	- GrayImages.cpp: main code file
	- CMakeLists.txt: cmake file
	- plotFraph.py: python script to plot fraph of duraion as function of threads
	- images: folder containing 10 images


Requirements:
	- openCV library
	- Boost 


Compiling and Running:
	- cmake .
	- make
	- ./GrayImages <Images Folder> <number of threads> <max of threads to compare>


Running Commands Examples:
	- ./GrayImages images/  ->  will run with defult number of threads (2).
	- ./GrayImages images/ 1  ->  will run with 1 thread only.
	- ./GrayImages images/ 4  ->  will run with 4 threads.
	- ./GrayImages images/ 3 7  ->  will run with 3 to 7 threads (will run 5 times).


Some explanations:
	The main program, GrayImage, is reciving folder with images and number of threads to run the X function on each 
	of the images. Threre is an option to add a second number to the input and this why the program will run
	several times, as number of threads is given. for example: running with the input 3 7 will run the program
	4 times, with 3, 4, 5, 6 and then with 7 threads.  
	The program will output to a file named "durations.txt" with the time durations for each number of threads.
	With the script "plotGraph.py" we can output a graph shows the results from "durations.txt" file.
	
	For running the script (only after running the GrayImage program) use this command:
	python3 plotGraph.py
